      Rise to Power: Napoleon rose to prominence during the French Revolution
      and became a general in the French army. His military successes and the
      chaos of the revolutionary period allowed him to seize power through a
      coup in 1799.

      Code Napoleon: He is also known for the Napoleonic Code (Code Napol√©on), a
      legal system that influenced many modern legal codes and is still
      influential in some countries today. Exile and Return: After suffering
      significant defeats and the occupation of France by Allied forces,
      Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814. He briefly returned to
      power in France during the Hundred Days in 1815 but was defeated at the
      Battle of Waterloo and exiled again, this time to the remote island of
      Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.
