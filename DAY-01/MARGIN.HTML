    <p>Web development is the practice of creating and managing websites and web applications, encompassing a wide array of tasks to ensure an effective online presence. It involves two main aspects: front-end development, focused on what users see and interact with, and back-end development, which handles the behind-the-scenes operations.

        Front-end developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure web content, style layouts, and make websites interactive. HTML provides the basic structure, CSS enhances the visual design, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features.</p>
