    <h1>Learning Pseudo Code</h1>
    <p>GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a revolutionary artificial intelligence model that has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing. Developed by OpenAI, GPT is a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture. It has been designed to understand and generate human-like text, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.</p>
   <br>
<p>GPT is "pre-trained" in the sense that it is initially exposed to vast amounts of text data from the internet, allowing it to learn the patterns, grammar, and context of human language. This pre-training phase equips GPT with a strong foundation for understanding and generating text in a coherent and contextually relevant manner.</p>
